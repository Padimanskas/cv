Hi, my name is Stanislav, and I'm a software developer with over 10 years of experience in web development. I specialize in building single-page applications (SPAs) using Vue and Angular. While I also have experience with React, my main focus is on Vue and Angular. I started my career in web development in 2011, and I've been honing my skills ever since. I’m confident in working with a wide range of web technologies and can build quality software for different types of projects. My first project back in 2011 involved developing a document management system using jQuery, PHP, and MySQL. Since then, I’ve worked on both product and outsourcing projects for clients in industries like geopositioning, oil extraction, logistics, IPTV/OTT, and trade.Outside of coding, I’m passionate about microprocessor electronics, IoT (Internet of Things), DIY projects, art, and animation.
